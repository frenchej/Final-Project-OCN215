## The Impact of Seismic Activity on Oceanic Primary Productivity

Given my research question to find whether or not seismic activity influences the release of nutrients from the seafloor, I hoped to then be able to make a connection to primary productivity and its impact on a marine ecosystem. My first results indicated the possibility that seismic activities play a role in the mixing of water in regards to nitrate concentration, but there was no clear evidence of an input of nitrate from the seafloor. My next results further supported the increase in the primary production of biomass but were unable to draw a connecting line between biomass and nutrient involvement. In summary, the amount of biomass present in the water column increases due to seismic activity, but I did not collect enough evidence to reason that nutrient concentrations are the leading cause.
